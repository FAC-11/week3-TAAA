## TEAM TAAA


### WHY


## WHAT (describing your site)


## HOW (describing the journey to completion)



## Notes

Talk through the Why, What, How of your project
How did you split up the work?
How did you choose to pair?
Walk us through the UX (user experience) i.e. demo your website
How well does it conform to your brief - the user stories
Walk us through your code. Prioritise the things you learned that were new to you, which the rest of your cohort could benefit from hearing about:
something you're proud of
something that you found really hard / struggled with
